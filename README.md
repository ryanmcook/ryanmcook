- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryanmcook
- 👀 I’m interested in Aerospace Engineering!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Aerospace Engineering (surprise!) and am enrolled in AFROTC.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Aero 361 projects!
- 📫 How to reach me - rmcook@iastate.edu, or 763-248-1102.
Less formally, I'm really into weightlifting, have a lot of nerdy hobbies, and enjoy walking around campus as opposed to CyRide / driving!
